# Ts-converter

ts-converter is a tiny browser extension that transforms a timestamp in a human readable date.
I created ts-converter with two goals:
1. Start to learn [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
2. I work a lot with timestamps

Available for:
* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ts-converter/)
* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ts-converter/emcknecpbdklccndlgpmkfkmkjpdabni)

## Requirements
* Elm >= 0.19

## Build

1. Compile source code with `scripts/compile.sh`
2. Create extension package with `scripts/build-unsigned`

## Quickstart dev

Run `elm reactor` to see the result of Elm code

## License

ts-converter is released under GPLv3
